# InstaProfile
This is my first application, developed with the intent to learn a bit more about Objective-C. 

The application main goal is to access and download both instagram profile pictures and stories of users.

<img width="30%" src="assets/img/screenshot/b.png" />
<img width="30%" src="assets/img/screenshot/c.png" />
</p>


### Todo
- Add some information about the user's profile on the profile view.
- Find a way to fetch stories of the user (external api's maybe?) and dispaly/download them.
